Description of Katamino:
Katamino has 12 different pieces. Every piece contains 5 squares, arranged in different ways. There are also filler pieces which are 1 or 2 squares. The classic katamino game is setup by dividing the board into two parts. After that both players are given five blocks and 4 filler blocks. The first player to fill their section with the given blocks is the winner of the game.[1]

Description and requirements of Katamino:
